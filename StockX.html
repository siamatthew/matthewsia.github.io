          <p>
            Sneakers have always been a passion of mine. For this project, I
            decided to research on the business of reselling sneakers for
            profit. I analyzed the potential sneakers resale value based on the
            existing consumer datasets from StockX (sneaker resale online
            marketplace) using Power Query and presented the insights with a
            visual and interactive dashboard using Microsoft Excel.
          </p>
          <h2>Backstory</h2>
          <p>
            My very first pair of sneakers were the
            <a
              href="https://stockx.com/nike-dunk-high-mesa-orange"
              target="_blank"
              >Nike Dunk High</a
            >, which I paid S$80 (US$60) for in 2004. They are currently valued
            at US$450 on StockX. That’s a return capital of more than 750% in
            seventeen years or so.
          </p>
          <p>
            Who would have thought that the sneaker reselling market would one
            day become mainstream? E-commerce sites such as
            <a href="https://stockx.com/" target="_blank">StockX</a> and
            <a href="https://www.goat.com/" target="_blank">Goat</a> have made
            it accessible for people who once did not have access to these
            exclusive releases.
          </p>
          <h3>Discovering the most valuable sneakers</h3>
          <p>
            For this project, I explored a StockX
            <a
              href="https://stockx.com/news/the-2019-data-contest/"
              target="_blank"
              >dataset</a
            >
            which contains the sales information for every transaction made in
            the US of Off-White and Yeezy brands from 2017 to 2019.
          </p>
          <p>
            From their data set, there are 8 variables to work with:<br />
            <span>&#8226;</span> Order date<br />
            <span>&#8226;</span> Brand<br />
            <span>&#8226;</span> Sneaker name<br />
            <span>&#8226;</span> Sale price<br />
            <span>&#8226;</span> Retail price<br />
            <span>&#8226;</span> Release date<br />
            <span>&#8226;</span> Shoe size<br />
            <span>&#8226;</span> Buyer state
          </p>

          <p>
            With that, I added another variable to the data set – the return of
            investment (ROI). I then created a visualisation which looked at the
            sales trend, top 10 sneakers with the best (ROI) and the region
            where these sneakers are the most “flippable”. Interactive features
            were added to the dashboard to provide further insights.
          </p>

          <p>
            Based on preference, the data can be filtered to view the most
            in-demand sneakers and their ROI. A specific sneaker model can also
            be analyzed in detail – from the number of pairs being sold over
            different years to the ROI of that pair.
          </p>

          <p>Here’s a preview of the initial dashboard:</p>
          <span class="image main"
            ><img src="images/CFK_Dashboard_full.gif" alt=""
          /></span>

          <p>
            When the respective year is selected, the dashboard will show the
            sales and profit based on the monthly performance of the year.
          </p>

          <p>
            The best investment is Air Jordan 1 - Retro High Off White Chicago,
            with a retail price of US$190. Its ROI increases every year, with
            2017 at 657%, 2018 at 957% and 2019 at 1256%.
          </p>
          <span class="image main"
            ><img src="images/CFK_ROI_OffWhite_1.png" alt=""
          /></span>
          <p>
            Here’s a table summary of the Air Jordan 1-Retro: In 2019, this shoe
            has a profit of $2,386. <i>Ka-ching!</i>
          </p>
          <span class="image main"
            ><img src="images/CFK_Summary_OffWhite_1.png" alt=""
          /></span>
          <p>
            When people flip sneakers, what they are really doing is buying
            exclusive models at retail price, waiting until the supply of the
            shoes decreases, and then reselling them at a much higher price.
          </p>
          <span class="image main"
            ><img src="images/CFK_Yeezy_Comparison.png" alt=""
          /></span>

          <p>
            If you want to focus on taking smaller gains in short term trends,
            Yeezy would be a good pair to invest because it is always in demand
            according to the StockX dataset. Recently, a pair of
            <a
              href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/kanye-west-sneakers-fetch-record-1-8-million-private-sale-n1265358"
              target="_blank"
              >Yeezy</a
            >
            (worn by Kayne West no less) sold for a record 1.8 million dollars!
          </p>
          <span class="image main"
            ><img src="images/CFK_Map.png" alt=""
          /></span>

          <p>
            The above visual illustrates where most of the buyers are coming
            from – the highest amount of sales are in California and New York.
            Even though these two major cities had the highest sales overall, it
            is also interesting to note that other regions also have substantial
            amount of sales – StockX has made these brands more accessible to
            areas where it was previously lesser known.
          </p>

          <p>
            In conclusion, selling sneakers is a lucrative business and can
            potentially lead to a windfall of profits in a short amount of time.
